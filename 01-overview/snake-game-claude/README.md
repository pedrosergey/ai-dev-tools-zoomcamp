# Snake Game (Claude)

This folder contains a small Snake game built with React and Vite. It was developed using Claude for code generation and instructions; the implementation demonstrates how an LLM can bootstrap a playable frontend app with styling, input handling, and game logic.

Run the app locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Notes
- **Authoring tool:** Claude — used to generate the original app and development instructions for VS Code.
- **Live artifact / demo:** https://claude.ai/public/artifacts/50a1e08a-6f49-4a5d-a5cf-211557c35da6

What you'll find here
- A Vite + React project with Tailwind styles, ESLint config and a simple single-file game implementation.

If you want me to adapt the README with more detailed dev/architecture notes or add a screenshot, say the word.

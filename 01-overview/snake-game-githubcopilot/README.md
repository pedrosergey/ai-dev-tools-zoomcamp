# Snake Game (GitHub Copilot)

This folder is a copy of the project generated with Claude but adapted and refactored using GitHub Copilot. The main change was moving the game logic into a dedicated `SnakeGame.jsx` component and keeping `App.jsx` as a thin wrapper.

Run the app locally

```bash
cd 01-overview/snake-game-githubcopilot
npm install
npm run dev
```

Notes
- **Purpose:** Demonstrate a fork/refactor workflow: copy the original project, refactor for clarity, and preserve a working frontend app.
- **Changes:** logic moved to `src/SnakeGame.jsx`; `src/App.jsx` now renders the component.

If you'd like I can add a short changelog or annotate the refactor with comments.

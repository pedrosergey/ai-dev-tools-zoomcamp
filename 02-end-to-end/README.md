# Snake Arena (End-to-End) 🐍

This folder contains a complete Snake game application, built as part of the **AI Dev Tools Zoomcamp**. It demonstrates how to build a modern web application with a separate frontend and backend, using AI tools to accelerate the process.

## Structure
- **frontend**: A React application built with Vite, TypeScript, and TailwindCSS. It handles the game logic, rendering, and user input. 🎨
- **backend**: (Coming soon/In progress) The server-side logic for the game. ⚙️

## Getting Started

To run the frontend:

1.  Navigate to the directory:
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    ```
2.  Install dependencies:

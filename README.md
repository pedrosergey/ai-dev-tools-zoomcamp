# AI Dev Tools Zoomcamp 🚀

This repo is my personal playground for the **AI Dev Tools Zoomcamp** by DataTalks — a hands-on course that teaches how to use AI to write better, faster, and smarter code.

As a data analyst / data engineer, I’m taking this zoomcamp to level up my tooling, speed up routine tasks, and explore practical ways to integrate AI into data workflows. Expect notes, small projects, experiments, and snippets that help me put concepts into practice.

## What you'll find here
- Short exercises and mini-projects from the course ✍️  
- Practical examples showing how AI can help with data cleaning, ETL, code generation, and testing 🧰  
- Personal notes, tips, and things I want to revisit later 📚

## Why I’m doing this
I want to get faster at building reliable data pipelines and writing cleaner, more maintainable code — and use AI as a force multiplier to do so. This repo documents the journey and makes it easy to reproduce the experiments.

## Thanks
Big thanks to the DataTalks team for creating the course and the original materials — this repo builds on their work and is inspired by their excellent content. 🙏
